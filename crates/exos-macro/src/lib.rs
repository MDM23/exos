/// Compiles real HTML into a sequence of string pushes.
///
/// The input is HTML: the tags, attributes and text you would write in a
/// `.html` file. Void elements are void, so `<br>` and `<link rel="...">` are
/// written the way HTML writes them rather than the XML-flavoured `<br/>` a
/// generic tag parser would insist on.
///
/// The one addition is that a braced block is Rust:
///
/// ```ignore
/// view! {
///     <ul class="files">
///         { entries.iter().map(row).collect::<Vec<_>>() }
///     </ul>
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Static parts become string literals in the binary, so nothing is parsed at
/// runtime. Interpolated values go through [`Render`](exos::Render) and are
/// escaped; `Markup` is the only exception.
///
/// An attribute written as a braced block contributes
/// [`Attributes`](exos::Attributes), which is how handlers and signal handles
/// attach to an element.

        /// so a template writes `favorite::post(entry.id, &controls)` and has
        /// the URL, the path parameter's type and the payload type all

///
/// Declaring the fields once is the point: the handler takes
/// `Json<Selection>`, the template binds `selection.picked`, and renaming the
/// field breaks both. Alongside the struct it generates a handle whose fields
/// are signals, a typed token per field for error reporting, and the
/// implementations that let the handle declare itself on an element and be
/// sent as a payload.
